# Resume Bullets (Stratcheck)

- Built a config-driven quant research delivery pipeline with CI-generated HTML reports and healthcheck artifacts, improving result reproducibility and review speed across local and GitHub Actions environments.
- Shipped a GitHub Pages demo workflow that publishes static report/dashboard deliverables from `/site`, enabling one-link technical walkthroughs for interviews and stakeholder reviews.
- Implemented run-level audit replay plus `bundle`/`reproduce` packaging, allowing cross-machine reproduction of strategy outputs and traceable investigation from `run_id` to final report.
