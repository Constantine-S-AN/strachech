## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public GitHub issue for potential vulnerabilities.

Use one of the following private channels:

- GitHub Security Advisory (preferred)
- direct maintainer contact in repository profile

Please include:

- affected version and environment
- clear reproduction steps or proof of concept
- severity estimate and impact scope
- any known mitigation

## Response Expectations

- Initial acknowledgement target: within 72 hours
- Triage and severity decision target: within 7 days
- Fix timeline depends on risk and release impact

Critical vulnerabilities may trigger an out-of-band patch release before the next milestone release.
